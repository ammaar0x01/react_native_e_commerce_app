- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).


## Naming Conventions 

```
Different files have different naming styles

- .ts files:

      > the main function must be in Pascal Case
      > NOTE: the 'view' suffix should not be used for layout files
